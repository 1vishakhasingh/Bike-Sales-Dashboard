# Bike-Sales-Dashboard

To achieve the goal of this project , I have completed several tasks:-

➡ Firstly ,Understanding the provided dataset.

➡ After that I performed the data cleaning in which I remove duplicate data,check the spelling ,remove blanks, use find and replace to maintain the standardization.

➡ Then for visualization purpose I use pivot table, various type of charts like column chart and Line charts so that viewers can easily understand the data insights.

Key insights:-

➡ People in Middle Age group (31-54 years) purchased 4 times more bikes as compared to the younger age and older age groups.

➡ The maximum average income of Males is $60,124 So , they purchased bikes more as compared to female.

➡ Customer tend to purchase bikes more for short commute (0-1 miles)
than longer commute (10 miles +)
